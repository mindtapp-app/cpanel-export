<p>MINDTAPP ("MINDTAPP," "our," "us," or "we") knows your privacy is important to you, and we are committed to providing safe and secure user experience.

<p>In addition to the information you provide directly to us, when you use MINDTAPP, we may automatically collect information about the computer, mobile device, or other devices you use to access MINDTAPP and about how you use MINDTAPP.

As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assist in collecting this information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Cookies and Other Electronic Technology</strong></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like many other companies, we and third parties that we work with use cookies and other web and mobile tracking technologies, like HTML5, web beacons, scripts,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pixels,&nbsp;server logs, and tags. We use these technologies for authentication, to store your preferences or progress, for analytics, and to help us advertise MINDTAPP. A&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to: (i)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of MINDTAPP you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; delivering content specific to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads, and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; impressions or clicks, measure the popularity of MINDTAPPand associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gather additional information through other methods.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; your&nbsp;browser for more information (e.g.,&nbsp;Internet Explorer;&nbsp;Google Chrome;&nbsp;Mozilla Firefox; or&nbsp;Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; including&nbsp;cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at&nbsp;Adobe's website. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; have access to certain features or offerings of MINDTAPP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Information Provided by Social Networking Services and Others</strong></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We may supplement the information you provide to us with additional information gathered from other sources, such as publicly available information, or from third&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; parties,&nbsp;such as marketers, partners, researchers, and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you that we obtain from such&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; third parties and information derived from any other product or service we provide.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you sign in to MINDTAPP using your Facebook or other third party credentials, we will use that service to authenticate you. We may also receive other information that&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you have agreed may be provided by that third party, such as your username, name, e-mail address, photo, location, date of birth, gender, an ID associated with the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; applicable third party platform, user files like photos and videos, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, and/or your posts or "likes." We receive this&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; information so that it can be used for the purposes explained in this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to have this information shared by these third parties, do not use&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Facebook or another third party to access MINDTAPP. We may also collect other information through other social networks that you make available to us. For a&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; description of how social networking and other third-party sites handle and share your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of service, which may&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; permit you to modify your privacy settings. We may combine information that we collect from or about you with information about you that we obtain from such social&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; media and other content platforms and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are a subject in a research project or study conducted by MINDTAPP in partnership with a researcher or educational institution, that project may involve the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; collection of different information than is described in this Section. Research participants may, for example, provide health-related information, including the existence of&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; certain health conditions. MINDTAPP partners with researchers and educational institutions in conducting such studies. Such research projects are typically done on an&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; anonymous basis, such that MINDTAPP acts only as a processor of anonymized or pseudonymized data. For further information on how we handle data associated with&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; such research, please refer to the materials distributed to you as part of the study, contact the researcher leading your study, or contact us using the contact information&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>How We Use Your Information at&nbsp;MINDTAPP</strong></u></p>

<p>We use your information to operate and provide you with MINDTAPP and other services. This includes, but is not limited to the following business and commercial purposes:</p>

<ul><li>For the purposes for which you provided it;</li>
<li>Authenticating your login and processing your payments;</li>
<li>Personalizing your MINDTAPP experience and customizing your training program;</li>
<li>Allowing you to monitor your performance and progress in MINDTAPP, by, for example, presenting charts and graphs of your performance to you;</li>
<li>Customizing and delivering information about our products and services by email;</li>
<li>To contact you with information, surveys, or advertising that we believe may be of interest to you regarding us or MINDTAPP;</li>
<li>To administer contests and surveys;</li>
<li>Providing customer support and sending confirmations about your Account;</li>
<li>For internal research and reporting;</li>
<li>Protecting our intellectual property or other rights; and</li>
<li>Managing and improving our business, our games, and our training.</li>
</ul><p>We also reserve the right to use and disclose non-personal data (e.g., de-identified or aggregate data) for any purpose. For example, we show aggregate performance measures to users to allow them to evaluate their performance against other MINDTAPP users. Also, in regard to research, we may disclose performance statistics to university collaborators to evaluate, study, and improve the effectiveness of our programs or psychological functioning more generally. In these situations, all data is disclosed either in aggregate form or with information that can identify you removed. In addition, when we work with university collaborators, we contractually prohibit them from attempting to re-identify individuals from data that has been de-identified.</p>

<p>We also use reCAPTCHA v.3 feature of Google to determine whether inputs are made by a natural person or by potentially abusive automated tools (bots). reCAPTCHA uses data such as IP address and activity patterns (e.g., typing/mouse movements) to make such determination. reCAPTCHA is subject to Google’s&nbsp;Terms of Service&nbsp;and&nbsp;Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Legal Bases For Use Of Your Personal Data</strong></u></p>

<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users’ requests in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.</li>
<li>Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent. Where you have provided consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out prior to withdrawing your consent. To withdraw your consent, please contact us at info@mindtapp.com.</li>
<li>Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as:</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Customer service;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Marketing;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Protecting our users, personnel, and property;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Analyzing and improving our business;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Processing job applications; and</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Managing legal issues.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - We may also process personal data for the legitimate interests of our research partners, such as to provide cognitive training, research, and analytics for such partners.</p>

<ul><li>Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</li>
<li>To protect the vital interests of the individual or others: For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent safety situation.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>No Disclosure to Third Parties for Their Own Marketing Purposes</strong></u></p>

<p>We believe in protecting your privacy, and therefore do not provide your personal data to third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>When We Share Your Personal Information With Third Parties</strong></u></p>

<p>We may share the categories of personal information identified in Section 1 for business purposes (as defined by applicable law) or as required by applicable law. More specifically, we may share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

<p><strong>Service providers and agents</strong></p>

<p>We may share your information with certain third parties selected by us to help support our operations. These include, for example, services that help us process payments, analyze web traffic, send emails, and track customer support requests. In addition, we may share limited personal data to third parties that help us market or advertise MINDTAPP. These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and we contractually require them to protect your information consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Affiliates</strong></p>

<ul><li>We may share your information with our affiliates, such as entities under common ownership or control.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Business transfers</strong></p>

<ul><li>We may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets in connection with an actual or contemplated merger, reorganization, business transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such scenarios, your information may be one of the assets transferred. We will post a notice or otherwise notify you and collect your consent, as may be required by law before the information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Compliance with law and law enforcement requests, and protection of our rights.</strong></p>

<ul><li>We may disclose your information when we have a good faith belief we are required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal mechanisms. We may also disclose your information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure may prevent fraud and abuse of MINDTAPP or its users or protect our property rights.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Consent</strong></p>

<ul><li>We may disclose your information when we believe we have your consent to do so, such as when you contact customer support and ask us about your Account, or when we have the consent of someone we believe is authorized to consent on behalf of you, such as the individual associated with the payment method for your Account. If you have expressly agreed to participate in a research study with us or with a third party that incorporates your personal data collected by MINDTAPP, we also may disclose your information for the purpose of facilitating the research to which you have consented.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Online Analytics And Tailored Advertising</strong></u></p>

<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on MINDTAPP, such as those of Google Analytics, Rollbar, and New Relic. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the "Cookies and other electronic technologies" section to help us analyze how users use MINDTAPP, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, how often you use our app, the events that occur within our app, where the app was downloaded from, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of MINDTAPP. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you receive an email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using MINDTAPP through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our websites, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, the information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be tailored to your interests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via MINDTAPP may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other devices to collect information about your use of MINDTAPP in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of MINDTAPP. We also may allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick, and others) to serve tailored ads to you on MINDTAPP, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other devices you use to access MINDTAPP. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other devices you use to access MINDTAPP by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt-out of ad targeting as described below. If&nbsp;you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link&nbsp;or the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link&nbsp;to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.</p>

<p>To opt-out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the&nbsp;Google Ads Settings page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into MINDTAPP, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>

To exercise any of the above&nbsp;rights (or any other rights under applicable law), please contact us at info@mindtapp.com.</li>
<li>The rights described herein are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law. In situations in which we process personal data on behalf of our research partners, we may refer the request to the relevant research partner and cooperate with their handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that research partner.</li>
<li>In addition to the rights above, residents of the European Economic Area also have the right to lodge a complaint with your relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Marketing</strong></u></p>

<p>You can opt-out of receiving marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each email. Please note you may not opt-out of certain transactional emails, such as when we email you to confirm transactions, address Account issues, or communicate about customer support.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Push Notifications</strong></u></p>

<p>From time to time, we use push notifications in our mobile applications to send you messages about MINDTAPP or your Account. You may opt-out from receiving push notifications through your device settings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>California Rights</strong></u></p>

<p>California residents have certain rights, subject to exceptions. California law may permit you to request that we:</p>

<ul><li>Provide you the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months; the categories of sources of such information; the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information; and the categories of third parties with whom we shared personal information.</li>
<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>
<li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li>
</ul><p>You may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you if any. You also have the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising certain of your rights. Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We need certain types of information so that we can provide our services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use MINDTAPP.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If would like to exercise any of these rights, please submit a request at info@mindtapp.com. We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>California residents may opt-out of the “sale” of their personal information. MINDTAPP does not “sell” your personal information as we understand that term to be defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Nevada Rights</strong></u></p>

<p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt-out of the sale of “personally identifiable information” for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Personally identifiable information” includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. We do not engage in such activity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Retention Of Personal Data And Security</strong></u></p>

<ul><li>We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it, or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.</li>
<li>We have implemented and maintain security practices to protect against the unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure of your personal data. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we, therefore, cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, please contact us using the contact information below.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Outside The United States Consent To Processing And Transfer Of Information</strong></u></p>

<p>If you access MINDTAPP outside of the United States, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of your personal data to, and the collection and processing of such personal data in the United States. The recipients of the personal data disclosures described in the "When We Share Your Personal Data with Third Parties" section above may be located in the United States or elsewhere in the world. Privacy laws in these countries may not provide protections equivalent to those of your country of residence, and your government may or may not deem such protections adequate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Additional Information</strong></u></p>

<ul><li><strong>Links To Third-Party Websites</strong></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Our website may include links to other sites that may collect personal data, and whose privacy practices may differ from those of MINDTAPP. Please be aware that we&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Blog</strong></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Our website may offer publicly accessible blogs. Some blog posts allow comments via Facebook. You may need to log in or contact Facebook both to post comments&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and to delete personal data that previously was posted in the comments. You can review Facebook’s privacy policy at this link:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Referrals And Contacts</strong></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- We may allow you to refer your friends and contacts to MINDTAPP, either by manually entering their email addresses or by importing contacts from email accounts you&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;have with third parties. If you choose to utilize these features, we will use and store the email addresses only for purposes of sending the invitation emails you have&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;requested. If you utilize these features, the friends or contacts that you refer may contact us at the contact information listed below to request that we delete their&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;personal data. Please note that we do not collect the username and password to your email accounts; the import features route you to the third party email provider to&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;log in through their services.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Social Media Widgets</strong></li>
</ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Our website may include social media features, such as Facebook and Twitter buttons. Such features may collect your IP address and information about the page you&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are visiting and may set cookies to function properly. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policies of the company providing them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Children</strong></u></p>

<p>MINDTAPP&nbsp;is not directed to individuals under 13 years old. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under the age of 13, children under the age of 14 in Spain or South Korea, or from an EU resident under the age of 16 without parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as required by law. As appropriate under applicable law, parents or legal guardians with questions or requests regarding their children’s personal data may contact us as described below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>California "Do Not Track" Notice</strong></u></p>

<p>We do not track our customers’ personal data over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore do not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Change Policy</strong></u></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice to you either by email, by posting a notification on MINDTAPP, or by posting an updated privacy policy on MINDTAPP 30 days in advance of the effective date of the updated Privacy Policy. Please note that, for existing users, unless otherwise provided by applicable law, your continued use of MINDTAPP following the effective date means that you agree with, and consent to be bound by, the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
